# Windows Installer and Auto Updater

##### This repository is used to test the process of bottling up a node/electron app into a windows installer with an auto updater based on github versions. It will also test be used to test the process used to create a windows shorcut that will be present on users desktops.

##### Just learned that using git tag must be pushed seperately from a regular git push. Also, this automatically creates a zip and tar.gz file of the project for you.
